 <h3>Pharo</h3>
 <p>Is a pure object-oriented programming language and a powerful environment, focused on simplicity and immediate feedback (think IDE and OS rolled into one).</p>
 <p> Check out our website! <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pharo.org/">https://www.pharo.org/</a>  </p>
 
 <h5> Simple & powerful language</h5>
 
 <p>No constructors, no types declaration, no interfaces, no primitive types. Yet a powerful and elegant language with a full syntax fitting in one postcard! Pharo is objects and messages all the way down.</p>

 <h5> Live, immersive environment</h5>
 <p>Immediate feedback at any moment of your development: Developing, testing, debugging. Even in production environments, you will never be stuck in compiling and deploying steps again!</p>

 <h5>Amazing debugging experience</h5>
 <p>The Pharo environment includes a debugger unlike anything you've seen before. It allows you to step through code, restart the execution of methods, create methods on the fly, and much more!</p>

 <h5>Pharo is yours</h5>
 <p>Pharo is made by an incredible community, with more than 100 contributors for the last revision of the platform and hundreds of people contributing constantly with frameworks and libraries.</p>


 <h5>Fully open-source</h5>
 <p>Pharo full stack is released under MIT License.</p>

     From public research to private business, from software & language research & development to  human rights hacktivism, Pharo community is a really rich meltingpot of international technological improvement, political struggle and beautiful human exchange!   </p>
