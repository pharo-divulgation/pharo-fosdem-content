 <h3> Open source is about <a href="https://pharo.org/community" target="_blank"> Community </a></h3>
 <p> The only thing we love more than our language, is our community. Pharo, community and our wonderful Smalltalk neighbours. With 28 years running ESUG conference has been our home since always. And we really think that the best way to show how beautiful is our community is by sharing our last experience together, on 2019, at Koln, Germany. 
  We hope COVID-19 to be soon an awful memory, and to come back to feel all this wonderful human beings sharing all this passion.

showcase: |
  
  <p>Come to our stand to meet the community behind Pharo. Meet key engineers and researchers behind the language development. Meet the rich multiple communities that pharo hubs, from radically different origins. 
  From public research to private business, from software & language research & development to  human rights hacktivism, Pharo community is a really rich meltingpot of international technological improvement, political struggle and beautiful human exchange!   </p>

new_this_year: |
 Pharo language has two faces, the industrial face and the research face. This last year we have been brewing many new things. Language/VM: We have take over the development of the JIT Compiler, implement a large battery of tests. Extend it to ARM64bits. We implemented a new system for threaded FFI calls, that allow us to have partial parallelism. We added new technologies on concurrent programming, that allow consistent definition of tasks and at some point binding with FFI threads if it is the case. IDE: We are working on automated distributed testing for reduce the testing time of the projects, allowing the developers to quickly run tests on development. We have been developing bindings to GTK, and extending our own IDE to have multiple bindings (so far, GTK and Morphic -a native approach-). We are beta testing our new debugger, and inspecting tools for live programming development. Including replay, object specific debugging, and other state of the art features. We implemented a markdown subset parser and rendered for having the language comments written in markdown.
