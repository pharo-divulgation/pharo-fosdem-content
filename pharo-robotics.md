ROS + Pharo! 
============

Pharo is a really powerful live-programming environment. 
There are many many possible usages of such a language, but probably one of the most excitings is on robotics. 
A live environment, managing a complex live process network controlling one or many robots.

Much work has been done specially by the CAR (ARTS) Team.

Some of this work is available to see on videos

And some of it has been also pursuited in Inria Lille.

 I still remembering our first presentation. It was in FOSDEM 14 :)

Artifitial Intelligence
===========




​​​​​





Tensor Flow is great solution for Artifitial intelligence. 
Pharo community values this open source contribution and because of that we propose bindings to Tensor Flow! 
[TensorFlow+Pharo@Github](https://github.com/PolyMathOrg/libtensorflow-pharo-bindings)

Keras Is also great way to interact with machine learning solutions.  And we do also provide bindings to it!

PolyMath
===========

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PolyMathOrg/PolyMath/master/assets/logos/logo.png)

PolyMath is a Pharo project, similar to existing scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy for Python or SciRuby for Ruby. PolyMath already provides the following basic functionalities:

- complex and quaternions extensions,
- random number generators,
- fuzzy algorithms,
- automatic differentiation,
- KDE-trees,
- Numerical methods,
- Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers.

The authoritative book on PolyMath is available [Software produced](https://github.com/SquareBracketAssociates/PolyMath-book)

Here a wonderful video on Data Analysis for Pharo with PolyMath!
