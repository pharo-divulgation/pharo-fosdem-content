PharoJS Project
================


PharoJS Project is mainly developed by Noury Bouraqadi & Dave Mason. 

Keep tuned on [Nootrix](https://nootrix.com/) for news on PharoJS! 


PharoJS is a set of tools and libraries (MIT license) that allow to benefit from the Pharo environment for the design of JavaScript applications. The development is carried out entirely in Pharo. The passage in production consists in converting this code to obtain in fine a JavaScript application.

All the code written by PharoJS application developers is Pharo code that creates and connects the application objects. These objects can come from the Pharo world as well as from the JavaScript world.

PharoJS allows to develop in Pharo applications executable by NodeJS or a web browser. We code in Pharo, then generate JavaScript for servers and web clients, as well as iOS and Android smartphones. It is possible to reuse and seamlessly integrate libraries from both the JavaScript and Pharo worlds.


Testing is core in Pharo development. 
On this video we can see a nice test running PharoJS, on pharo language and on the browser! Magic :)

PyBridge
========

PyBridge is a really nice project on the intercommunication with Python. 
PyBridge allows a bidirectional communication, allowing Python to use Pharo, Pharo to use Python. 

It may be the beginning of a wonderful friendship :)
