Pharo: a pure object oriented environment
==========================================


​​​​​
Pharo is a full inspectable object oriented environment. This may sound as a marketing speach, but the real thing is that it means much fun!

​​​​​



A full introspectable runtime
===============================


​​​​​

In Pharo we want you to be able to take control over each detail.
By each detail, we also mean to modify the compiler that compiles the code you want to compile, or to modify the behavior of the windows you use to modify the code of those windows.

Could debugging been a wonderful experience? 
==========================================

Environments often divide the codign experience from the language it self. No wonder, debugging is such a painful experience.
Is this pain what pushes us to think debugging as a last resource.
Is not that some kind of weird behavior? Should not be debugging (As interacting with a living environment, object of our creativity) a source of joy and amusement? 
In such an live-programming environment, debugging experience becomes not only not painful, but desirable and enjoyable

Do you love Music?! 
=================


We love music too. We just like it from different sources, and without publicity if possible. 
Here a video of the Event Music Player. Developed on pharo, base on pharo interoperability with C! 
Thanks VLC. You are the best friend.
