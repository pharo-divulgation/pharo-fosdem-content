Pharo: a pure object oriented environment
==========================================

Pharo is a full inspectable object oriented environment. This may sound as a marketing speach, but the real thing is that it means much fun!

A full introspectable runtime
===============================

In Pharo we want you to be able to take control over each detail.
By each detail, we also mean to modify the compiler that compiles the code you want to compile, or to modify the behavior of the windows you use to modify the code of those windows.

In such an environment, debugging experience becomes not only not painful, but desirable and enjoyable
